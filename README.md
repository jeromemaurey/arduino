Traffic Light
--------------

A simple traffic light using 2 LEDs and 2 Push Buttons. The push buttons toggle between two modes: Manual and Automatic.
- Automatic uses a random delay to switch between lights
- Manual toggles lights on push

This project is in two parts:
- The mount I designed can be dowloaded and 3D printed here http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:93925
- The program for the Arduino can be retrived from this repository

Make sure to either map the LEDs and Push Buttons according to the pins used in the script or update the variables to reflect your setup.
